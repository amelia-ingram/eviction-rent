    "In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, New Yorkers have feared a rise in housing evictions across the city as landlords attempt to recover their losses and forcibly evict tenants.  As housing courts have reopened and the eviction deferment period is long passed, we are now seeing a rise in evictions across the city.  According to a NY Times article, the housing chaos began this spring:<br> \n",
    "> \"The roughly 2,000 eviction cases filed by landlords every week since March are roughly 40 percent more than the number filed in mid-January [2022], after the stateâ€™s eviction moratorium expired. Tenants have been thrown out of homes in more than 500 cases since February, according to city data, about double the number in all of the 20 months prior.\" (Zaveri, 2022)\n",

    "In this project we will attempt to test the relationship of housing evictions to a variety of neighborhood demographics including changes in the fair market housing rates (FMR) through exploratory data analysis (EDA) using data selected from the <b>Eviction Lab</b>, <b>ACS</b> and the <b>Housing and Urban Development</b> (HUD) datasets.

These may not include forcible evictions that happen in unofficial living arrangements (such as \"cash only\" housing in illegal sublets, frequented by poor and undocumented populations).

    "## Assumptions <a id=2.1></a>\n",
    "Recent evidence produced from several housing research centers predict that there will be a strong increase in housing evictions in the New York City metropolitan area, despite the best efforts of both city and state agencies to prevent a massive rise in homelessness.  We assume that there could be some evidence of a relationship between incident areas where eviction rates are high and increases in fair market rent (FMR) that could potentially displace lower income communities and lead to further gentrification (or else be signs of future gentrification). In this case, we assume that a rise in fair market rent (FMR) will indicate displacement of low income populations from previously affordable subsidized housing. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Office of Policy Development and Research (see Summary), the FMR was implemented in 1974 to help low-income households find affordable housing. This is generally known as the Section 8 voucher system.  According to their Summary page, the FMR is defined as \"the 40th percentile of gross rents for typical, non-substandard rental units occupied by recent movers in a local housing market.\" (Further information and problematics in the calculation of this rate are discussed on HUD's Summary page).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that race also plays a crucial role in both eviction rates and rental rates.  Government and local experts have historically suggested this as a trend.  Recently, a report was published by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights which outlines the recent issues of racial discrimination in evictions (2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for the purposes of this research we assume that the housing market in New York City is fixed (this is a reasonable assumption given the pandemic slowdown of new building construction).\n",
